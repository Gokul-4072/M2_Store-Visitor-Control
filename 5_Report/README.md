# **STORE VISITOR CONTROL**

## INTRODUCTION:

The "STORE VISITOR CONTROL" project is built on the connecting of several components with an Arduino microcontroller, such as sensors, motors, and so on. People can be counted in both directions using this counter. This circuit can be used to count the number of people entering a store at the entrance gate, and it can also count the number of people leaving the hall by decrementing the count at the same gate or exit gate, depending on the location of the sensors in the store, and show number of people inside the store.

In today’s world, there is continuous need automatic appliance will be increase in standard of living, there is a sense of urgency for developing circuit that would ease the complexity of life. Also if someone wants to know the number of persons present in a room so as not to have congestion, the circuit prove to be helpful.The theme of this project when merged with certain established technologies can be quite effective in number of countries like Germany, France & Japan etc. 

This Project is useful in developing countries and this project has a bright future. This project helps us to control the light of a room automatically and counts the number of persons/visitors entering and leaving the room. By using this circuit and proper power supply we can implement various applications such as fans, tube lights, etc


## COMPONENTS:

* ATMEGA328

* ULTRASONIC SENSOR

* 16x2 lCD DISPLAY

* BUZZER


## ATMEGA MICROCONTROLLER:

The Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 32 KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1 KB EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general-purpose I/O lines, 32 general-purpose working registers, 3 flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented 2-wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8 channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, and 5 software-selectable power-saving modes.


## ULTRASONIC SENSOR:

An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves.
An ultrasonic sensor uses a transducer to send and receive ultrasonic pulses that relay back information about an object’s proximity.  
High-frequency sound waves reflect from boundaries to produce distinct echo patterns.


## LCD-HD44780:

The Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller is an alphanumeric dot matrix liquid crystal display (LCD) controller developed by Hitachi in the 1980s. The character set of the controller includes ASCII characters, Japanese Kana characters, and some symbols in two 28 character lines. Using an extension driver, the device can display up to 80 characters.[1] The HD44780 is one of the most popular character LCDs ever made, with numerous third-party displays using its 16-pin interface and instruction set for compatibility.

## ADVANTAGES:

* Easy Monitoring

* Reduce man power to check how many people inside the store

* Low Cost

* No need of human intervention.

* Can work 24x7 without any problem.

* Low cost and very easy to implement.


## DISADVANTAGES:

* If there are multiple doors for the same room the project becomes quite complex.

* US sensor cannot detect if lots of people are entering at one time.

* Only we get people count,no visual control is there.


## OBJECTIVES:

* This project is built on the connecting of several components with an Arduino microcontroller, such as sensors, motors, and so on. People can be counted in both directions using this counter. 

* This circuit can be used to count the number of people entering a store at the entrance gate, and it can also count the number of people leaving the hall by decrementing the count at the same gate or exit gate, depending on the location of the sensors in the store, and show number of people inside the store.


## CONCLUSION:

When someone enters, the visitor is added, and therefore the LCD display displays the number of incoming visitors. and the light is activated automatically.
Basically, when an individual leaves the room or exits, the visitor is reduced. Thus the entire number of current visitors displayed in LCD is also reduced. The LCD display also displays the number of visitors visiting the room and also the number of visitors leaving.This is how Bidirectional Visitor Counter works with Automatic Light Control system using Arduino. It is useful for project hall, school, office, function, etc.
